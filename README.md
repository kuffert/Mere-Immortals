<div>Mere Immortals is a tablet-based digital card game designed around Ancient Grecian Mythology, where players face off controlling the weather, and the destiny of a small Town. Select a Greek God or Goddess and compete for the favor of The Townsfolk, blessing them with good weather and fortune. But again, turn the tides of nature against The Town to bring opponents down on their turns to sabotage others and gain the lead.</div><br>
<br>
<div>This game was our capstone project for GAME3800: Game Development and Production. It is designed to be played on a tablet for 4-6 players at a time, ages 10 and up. This game was made entirely with Unity 5, GIMP 2, and Ableton Live 9.<br>
